# module22_homework

This repository contains all of tasks I have completed in the module 22.

## How to navigate tasks

You can see folders (submodules) named in this format:

```none
task-{number}-{short-description}-{lesson}
```

where:

- `{number}` is the task number(s);
- `{short-description}` is the short description of what the task is using in 1-2 words;
- `{lesson}` is the lesson number.

Each of tasks has their own GitHub Pages website. You can use either their own GitHub Page or use the following format:

```none
https://ivan-developer-01.github.io/module22_homework/{task}
```

where `{task}` is the folder of the task. For example, <https://ivan-developer-01.github.io/module22_homework/task-1-2-svg-3>.
